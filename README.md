# SEO Services App

Welcome to the SEO Services App! This project is designed to help prospects and potential clients purchase SEO services or use a free SEO checker tool. Additionally, it simplifies the client's (a marketing agency's) job by allowing them to track their revenue, sales, and client information through a dedicated admin dashboard. Authenticated users (via Supabase) can access the admin dashboard, while mock data was used for development purposes, especially for blog posts.

## Project Overview

The SEO Services App is designed to assist users in purchasing SEO services or using a free SEO checker tool. It also provides a dashboard for marketing agencies to track sales, revenue, and client information. The app features pages for Home, Blog, Tools, Products, Order Confirmation, and an Admin Dashboard. The admin dashboard is accessible only to authenticated users via Supabase.

## Team

- **Kagiso Motlhaoleng**: Frontend Developer and UX Designer
- **Solo**: Project Lead and Developer

## Architecture and Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: Vite + React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Styling**: Plain CSS
- **User Authentication**: Supabase
- **Mock API**: Postman
- **UI Library**: Material UI
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

## Frontend Framework and Routing

The application uses Vite with React and TypeScript for robust and scalable frontend development. React Router is utilized for navigating between pages such as Home, Blog, Tools, Products, Order Confirmation, and Admin Dashboard.

## Styling and UI Libraries

Plain CSS is used for styling the application. Material UI was incorporated to build responsive and visually appealing UI components.

## User Authentication

Supabase handles user authentication, ensuring that only logged-in users can access the Admin Dashboard. 

## Mock API and Data Handling

Mock data was generated and handled using Postman for blog posts and SEO tools during development. This approach allowed for simulating real data interactions without relying on live data.
